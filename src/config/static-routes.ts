// Canonical declaration of which routes the build is expected to prerender
// as static HTML. Consumed by scripts/check-static-routes.mts to fail the
// build when reality diverges from this list.
//
// Why centralized: this list is the contract between page-level decisions
// (where generateStaticParams is declared) and build-time invariants (what
// the prerender manifest should contain). Putting it in a config file makes
// it discoverable, reviewable in isolation, and prevents the script from
// becoming a hidden source of truth.
//
// To make a route dynamic-by-design, remove it from STATIC_LOCALIZED_SUBPATHS /
// STATIC_NON_LOCALIZED_ROUTES and add its pattern to
// INTENTIONALLY_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_PATTERNS as documentation.
